Authors are encouraged to specify a lang attribute on the root html element, giving the document’s language. This aids speech synthesis tools to determine what pronunciations to use, translation tools to determine what rules to use, and so forth.</a>

The manifest attribute gives the address of the document’s application cache manifest, if there is one. If the attribute is present, the attribute’s value must be a valid non-empty URL potentially surrounded by spaces.</p>

  This CSS module defines CSS support for various international writing modes and their combinations, including left-to-right and right-to-left text ordering as well as horizontal and vertical orientations. These new CSS features allow a mixture of horizontal and vertical text regions on the same page.</p>
  <p>The specification also adds support for such things as isolation in bidirectional text, glyph orientation controls, and short, inline horizontal runs in lines of vertical text.</p>
